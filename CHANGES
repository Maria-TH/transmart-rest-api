The version number follows semantic versioning: minor number updates indicate backward compatible changes, major
number updates indicate backward-incompatible versions. In that case clients will usually need to be updated.
Add any changes that change the endpoints or the data they return here. 

INCREMENT THE VERSION NUMBER IF YOU RELEASE A CHANGED VERSION! Then clients can fail gracefully instead of raising some exception.


3.0
===

The first version with a version number.

added: 
	- /patient_sets endpoint

changed:
	- SubjectController no longer returns the database id of patients. The database id should not be used outside of Transmart, and was not 
	useful anyway since it was not exposed anywhere else. Use the inTrialId instead. This change breaks old R clients since they use the 'id' 
	column as the name in the patients data frame.


earlier versions
================

Earlier versions do not have a version number.

There are two known incompatible changes in the past:

- /oauth/verify got changed to /oauth/inspectToken for checking if a token is still valid. The latter 
  returns different more useful information, and the former no longer works for this purpose.
- A new version of the oauth plugin no longer accepts GET requests for logging in, which the R client uses.
  The R client needs to change to using POST requests.
